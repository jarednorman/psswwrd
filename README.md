Psswwrd.rb is just another password generator
=============================================

This particular password generator takes a single argument (the desired length of the password) and a returns an alphanumeric password that can be typed without have to hit more than one key with the same hand in a row (i.e. you hit keys alternating hands). You never need to hit keys with your pinky fingers (except for shift), so the password generated should be fairly easy to type quite quickly.
